## What Caused The Tiananmen Square Protests?

<p align="justify">In the 1980s, China was going through huge changes. The ruling Communist Party began to allow some private companies and foreign investment. Leader Deng Xiaoping hoped to boost the economy and raise living standards. However, the move brought with it corruption, while at the same time raising hopes for greater political openness. The Communist Party was divided between those urging more rapid change and hardliners wanting to maintain strict state control. In the mid-1980s, student-led protests started. &nbsp; <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-48445934">:link:</a></p>

<p align="justify">The Tiananmen Square protests, known as the June Fourth Incident in China, were student-led demonstrations held in Tiananmen Square, Beijing, during 1989. The protests started on April 15 and were forcibly suppressed on June 4 when the government declared martial law and sent the People's Liberation Army to occupy parts of central Beijing. &nbsp; <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1989_Tiananmen_Square_protests_and_massacre">:link:</a></p>

<p align="justify">The protests were precipitated by the death of pro-reform Chinese Communist Party (CCP) general secretary Hu Yaobang in April 1989, amid the backdrop of rapid economic development and social change in post-Mao China, reflecting anxieties among the people and political elite about the country's future. Although they were highly disorganized and their goals varied, the students called for greater accountability, constitutional due process, democracy, freedom of the press, and freedom of speech. At the height of the protests, about one million people assembled in the square. &nbsp; <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1989_Tiananmen_Square_protests_and_massacre">:link:</a></p>

## Who Was The Tank Man?

<p align="justify">Tank Man is the nickname of an unidentified Chinese man who, on June 5, 1989, faced down a column of People’s Liberation Army (PLA) tanks on Chang’an Avenue in Beijing. The encounter came one day after the government launched a bloody crackdown that killed an unknown number of people in Beijing and cleared protesters from Tiananmen Square. Tank Man, as he was dubbed by the international media, became an enduring symbol of defiance in the face of violent authoritarianism. &nbsp; <a href="https://www.britannica.com/biography/Tank-Man">:link:</a></p>

<p align="justify">As the lead tank maneuvered to pass by the man, he repeatedly shifted his position in order to obstruct the tank's attempted path around him. The incident was filmed and shared with a worldwide audience. Internationally, it is considered one of the most iconic images of all time. Inside China, the image and the accompanying events are subject to censorship. &nbsp; <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tank_Man">:link:</a></p>

<p align="justify">Having successfully brought the column to a halt, the man climbed onto the hull of the buttoned-up lead tank and, after briefly stopping at the driver's hatch, appeared in video footage of the incident to call into various ports in the tank's turret. He then climbed atop the turret and seemed to have a short conversation with a crew member at the gunner's hatch. After ending the conversation, the man descended from the tank. The tank commander briefly emerged from his hatch, and the tanks restarted their engines, ready to continue on. At that point, the man, who was still standing within a meter or two from the side of the lead tank, leapt in front of the vehicle once again and quickly re-established the man–tank standoff. &nbsp; <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tank_Man">:link:</a></p>

## Why China Massacred Its Own People?

<p align="justify">The numbers of protesting students and workers steadily grew. A rally on May 19 in the square drew an estimated 1.2 million people, leading then-Communist Party leader Zhao Ziyang to meet with them to plead for an end to the protests. Trucks of soldiers began to arrive in Beijing, but still the protests didn't stop. After a tense two weeks, on the night of June 3, convoys of armed troops entered Beijing with the aim of clearing the square by whatever means necessary. Blocked by civilians in the streets who were attempting to protect the students, the troops opened fire. Students, workers and other ordinary citizens fought back, setting fire to some military vehicles, but they were overwhelmed. &nbsp; <a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2019/06/02/asia/tiananmen-square-june-1989-intl/index.html">:link:</a></p>

<p align="justify">Witnesses told horrific stories of tanks driving over unarmed protesters and soldiers shooting indiscriminately into crowds. No official death toll was ever released by the Chinese government, but human rights groups estimate it was in the hundreds, if not thousands. Thirty years have passed since that bloody night. Beijing has patched up the bullet pockmarks along the Avenue of Eternal Peace and repaired the tank damage to Tiananmen Square. Chinese propaganda has scrubbed the democracy movements and massacres from history, so that many young Chinese have no idea that the Communist Party massacred its own people. &nbsp; <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/01/opinion/sunday/tiananmen-square-protest.html">:link:</a></p>
